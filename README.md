## Overview

This project leverages modern JavaScript and 3D web technologies to deliver an immersive user experience. The frontend is built with React and JSX, powered by Vite for fast development and bundling. Core libraries include react-router-dom for routing, framer-motion for animations, and @react-three/fiber for 3D rendering. Custom styling is handled with CSS and enhanced by tools like leva and zustand for state management.

Deployment is handled using Vercel (for the frontend) and Render (for backend services), ensuring seamless CI/CD integration and live testing. The project is publicly accessible, and continues to evolve and planned game logic expansions, with a focus on real-time gameplay and multiplayer interactions in future iterations.

The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, serving as the core of the gameâ€™s logic and user interactions. The project integrates multiple databases PostgreSQL via Supabase for user authentication and MySQL via InfinityFree to store and manage game data, user accounts, and game progression.
